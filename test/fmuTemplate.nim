#  C-code FMUs have functions names prefixed with MODEL_IDENTIFIER_.
#  Define DISABLE_PREFIX to build a binary FMU.
#  This header file must be utilized when compiling a FMU.
#    It defines all functions of the
#          FMI 2.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation Interface.
#    In order to have unique function names even if several FMUs
#    are compiled together (e.g. for embedded systems), every "real" function name
#    is constructed by prepending the function name by "FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX".
#    Therefore, the typical usage is:
#       #define FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX MyModel_
#       #include "fmi2Functions.h"
#    As a result, a function that is defined as "fmi2GetDerivatives" in this header file,
#    is actually getting the name "MyModel_fmi2GetDerivatives".
#    This only holds if the FMU is shipped in C source code, or is compiled in a
#    static link library. For FMUs compiled in a DLL/sharedObject, the "actual" function
#    names are used and "FMI2_FUNCTION_PREFIX" must not be defined.
#    Revisions:
#    - Apr.  9, 2014: all prefixes "fmi" renamed to "fmi2" (decision from April 8)
#    - Mar. 26, 2014: FMI_Export set to empty value if FMI_Export and FMI_FUNCTION_PREFIX
#                     are not defined (#173)
#    - Oct. 11, 2013: Functions of ModelExchange and CoSimulation merged:
#                       fmiInstantiateModel , fmiInstantiateSlave  -> fmiInstantiate
#                       fmiFreeModelInstance, fmiFreeSlaveInstance -> fmiFreeInstance

#                       fmiResetSlave -> fmiReset (now also for ModelExchange and not only for CoSimulation)
#                     Functions renamed:

#                        fmiExitSlaveInitializationMode;
#    - Feb. 17, 2013: Portability improvements:
#                        o DllExport changed to FMI_Export
#                        o FUNCTION_PREFIX changed to FMI_FUNCTION_PREFIX
#                        o Allow undefined FMI_FUNCTION_PREFIX (meaning no prefix is used)

#                     Removed fmiGetStateValueReferences.
#    - Nov. 14, 2011: Adapted to FMI 2.0:
#                        o Split into two files (fmiFunctions.h, fmiTypes.h) in order
#                          that code that dynamically loads an FMU can directly
#                          utilize the header files).
#                        o Added C++ encapsulation of C-part, in order that the header
#                          file can be directly utilized in C++ code.
#                        o fmiCallbackFunctions is passed as pointer to fmiInstantiateXXX
#                        o stepFinished within fmiCallbackFunctions has as first
#                          argument "fmiComponentEnvironment" and not "fmiComponent".
#                        o New functions to get and set the complete FMU state
#                          and to compute partial derivatives.

#                     Renamed macro fmiGetModelFunctionsVersion to fmiGetVersion
